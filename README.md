# Hashira - Quadratic Equation Constant C Finder

This project contains three implementations for finding the constant C in a quadratic equation axÂ² + bx + c using roots provided in JSON format.

## Implementations

### 1. main.java

A simple implementation that:
- Uses a custom JSON parser
- Reads input from JSON files (test1.json and ex.json)
- Decodes values from different number bases to decimal
- Calculates the constant C using the product of roots
- Uses double for calculations

### 2. MainLagrange.java

An advanced implementation that:
- Uses a custom JSON parser (no external dependencies)
- Reads input from JSON files (test1.json and ex.json)
- Implements Lagrange interpolation to find the constant C
- Uses BigInteger for precise calculations with large numbers
- Implements a custom BigFraction class for exact rational arithmetic

### 3. shamir.js

A Node.js implementation that:
- Uses Shamir's Secret Sharing scheme with Lagrange interpolation
- Reads input from JSON files (test1.json and ex.json)
- Supports arbitrary base conversion for input values
- Uses BigInt for handling large numbers
- Provides detailed output with step-by-step calculations
- Saves results to a results.json file with structured output

## Input Files

- `test1.json`: Contains the first test case with 4 roots
- `ex.json`: Contains the second test case with 10 roots

## Running the Code

### main.java
```
javac main.java
java main
```

### MainLagrange.java
```
javac MainLagrange.java
java MainLagrange
```

### shamir.js
```
node shamir.js
```

## Results

The implementations produce different constant C values due to their different mathematical approaches:

### Test Case 1
- main.java: Constant C = 336.0 (product of roots)
- MainLagrange.java: Constant C = 3 (Lagrange interpolation with exact arithmetic)
- shamir.js: Constant C = 3 (Shamir's Secret Sharing with Lagrange interpolation)

### Test Case 2
- main.java: Constant C = 6.825131192247421E124 (double representation with limited precision)
- MainLagrange.java: Constant C = -6290016743746469796 (BigInteger representation with exact precision)
- shamir.js: Constant C = -6290016743746469796 (BigInt representation with exact precision)

The difference in results is due to the different mathematical approaches used:
- main.java simply multiplies the roots together (Vieta's formula)
- MainLagrange.java and shamir.js use Lagrange interpolation to find the constant term in the polynomial, which is mathematically equivalent to Shamir's Secret Sharing scheme
